Q1:Difference between Compiler and  interpreter?
Sol: 	A source code or java code after creation will first gets compiled and a byte code will be created 
        this byte code is interpreted by the java virtual machine(JVM) and create an executable code
  	Compiler :
		1: The java compiler compiles the java source code(high level language or human readble)
	     	     and cretes a .class file known as byte code.	
		2: While compilation compiler checks for the errors if any error found compile throws an 
		     error and .class file will not be created.
		3: This byte code or .class file is portable and platform independent.
	Interpreter:
		1: Interpreter is inside the jvm will take the .class file interprets the code to and executable 
		    or runnable code.
		2: Interpreter interprets the byte code line by line.
		3: Inside  jvm we have class loader which loads the class, bytecode verifier which verifies the 
		    compiled code and a JIT compiler which keeps the track of interpreted code. thus an actuall
		    runnable machine code is created by the jvm
